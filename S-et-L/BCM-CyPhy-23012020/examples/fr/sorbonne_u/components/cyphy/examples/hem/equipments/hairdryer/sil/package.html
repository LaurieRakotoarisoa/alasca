This package defines DEVS SIL simulation models used in the hair dryer
component.
</p>

<p>
This simulation model uses two complementary atomic models:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>HairDryerSILModel</code> keeps track of the operating mode
  of the hair dryer by peeking the component for its current operating and
  associates to the operating mode the level of electricity consumption.
  It exports an event giving its current consumption emitted each time a
  change is observed in this level.</li>
<li>The <code>HairDryerSILUserModel</code> implements usage scenarios
  calling the hair dryer services to change its operating mode.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The coupled model <code>HairDryerSILCoupledModel</code> connects the two
previous atomic models. It can be executed as a stand alone SIL simulation
to perform unit testing of the component.
</p>

<p>
To run a SIL simulation after the implementation of the component, use
the class <code>CVM</code> in the package <code>unittest</code>.
